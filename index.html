            >the SSD program</a
          >
          to gain more experience and knowledge in back-end and strengthen my
          front-end skills. My friend Maria Revelo who was a part of the
          previous cohort of the SSD and with whom I attended the BrainStation
          coding bootcamp recommended me this program as a good way to improve
          as a Junior Web Developer.

          I am very excited to be here and contribute to the world of
          programming! P.S. So far this page looks like it's Internet of year
          2000 which is nostalgic for me... I will improve it with the magic of
          CSS once we move on to it :)
